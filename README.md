## Supported Field Types

Knifest-DebugTools provides several types of fields you can add to your debug panel:

- **DebugFields**: Standard input fields for types like int, float, bool, string, and enum. These fields invoke a UnityEvent automatically whenever the value changes.
  - Examples: IntDebugField, FloatDebugField, BoolDebugField, StringDebugField, EnumDebugField
- **ActionDebugFields**: Input fields with an action button. The UnityEvent is only invoked when the button is pressed, not on every value change.
  - Examples: IntActionDebugField, FloatActionDebugField, BoolActionDebugField, StringActionDebugField
- **Simple Button**: You can also add a button without any input field, which simply invokes a UnityEvent when pressed.

You can mix and match these field types in your debug panel to suit your workflow. All field prefabs are available in the prefab folder and can be dragged into the container as needed.

## How to Use

### Add the Debug Panel

- Use the Unity menu: `Knifest > Add DebugTools`, or right-click in the Hierarchy and select `Knifest > Add DebugTools`.
- If a GameObject is selected, the debug panel will be added as its child.

### Modify the Debug Panel

- Open the container: `Knifest > Open Container`.
- In the Hierarchy, find `-- CONTAINER -- (Edit here)`.
- Open the prefab folder: `Knifest > Open Prefab Folder`.
- Drag & drop field prefabs into the container for any type you need.
- Select a field to edit its Label, Default Value, and link methods/properties to UnityEvents in the Inspector.
- When finished editing, close the container using `Knifest > Close Container`.

### Play and Debug

- Enter Play mode. In the running game, look for the debug tools button (see icon below) in the corner of the screen.

- Click this button to open or close the debug panel at runtime.
- Use the debug panel to tweak values, trigger actions, and monitor changes in real time.

## Enum Debug Fields

Knifest-DebugTools makes it easy to debug enum fields with a dropdown and UnityEvent callback.

**How to add an enum debug field:**

1. Create a class that inherits from `EnumDebugFieldInstruction<YourEnumType>` (see example below).
2. Add a prefab of Enum Debug Field to the container, following the instructions above.
3. In the Inspector, click the field named **Instruction** and select your custom instruction type from the dropdown (it will list all types that implement `IEnumDebugFieldInstruction`).
4. The dropdown in the debug panel will automatically show all values of your enum.
5. You can now assign UnityEvent callbacks that are strongly typed to your enum type.

**Example:**

Suppose you have an enum:
```csharp
public enum GameState { Menu, Playing, Paused, GameOver }
```

Create an instruction:
```csharp
[Serializable]
public class GameStateDebugFieldInstruction : EnumDebugFieldInstruction<GameState> { }
```

Assign this instruction to your Enum Debug Field in the inspector.  
Now, when you select a value from the dropdown, the UnityEvent will fire with the selected enum value.

## Editor Menu

- **Add DebugTools**: Quickly add the debug panel prefab to your scene.
- **Open/Close Container**: Focus and expand/collapse the debug panel in the hierarchy.
- **Open Prefab Folder**: Jump to the folder with field prefabs for easy customization.
